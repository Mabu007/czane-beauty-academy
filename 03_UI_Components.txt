UI COMPONENTS DEPENDENCY MAP

These files are visual building blocks used across multiple pages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. FILE: components/Navbar.tsx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE:
Main navigation header. It contains logic to show/hide links based on authentication status.

DEPENDS ON:
- firebase.ts (Auth state)
- services/authService.ts (getIsAdmin function)
- react-router-dom (Navigation)

USED BY (Downstream Dependencies):
- App.tsx (Rendered globally)

HIERARCHY CHECKLIST (If you change this file):
1. Mobile: Check mobile responsiveness. If broken, users on phones cannot navigate.
2. Auth State: Login as a student and ensure "Admin Dashboard" does NOT appear. Login as Admin and ensure it DOES appear.

OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- The admin check happens on mount. If authService.ts is slow, the navbar might "flicker" the wrong links. Consider caching the admin claim in local state or context.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. FILE: components/QuizBuilder.tsx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE:
A complex form component used to add/edit/delete quiz questions.

DEPENDS ON:
- types.ts (QuizQuestion interface)
- lucide-react (Icons)

USED BY (Downstream Dependencies):
- pages/admin/Dashboard.tsx (Embedded in the lesson editor)

HIERARCHY CHECKLIST (If you change this file):
1. Data Flow: This component receives props (questions) and emits changes (onChange). If you change the internal logic, verify that AdminDashboard.tsx actually receives the updated array.
2. UI: If you change the layout, ensure it fits within the sidebar width of AdminDashboard.tsx.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. FILE: components/Footer.tsx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE:
Static footer information.

DEPENDS ON:
- react-router-dom (Location hook to hide on admin pages)

USED BY (Downstream Dependencies):
- App.tsx (Rendered globally)

HIERARCHY CHECKLIST (If you change this file):
1. Visibility: Ensure it does NOT appear on /admin/dashboard.
